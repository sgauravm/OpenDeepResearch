Read content from a file in the virtual filesystem with optional pagination.

This tool returns file content with line numbers (like `cat -n`) and supports reading large files in chunks to avoid context overflow.

Parameters:
- file_path (required): Path to the file you want to read
- offset (optional, default=0): Line number to start reading from  
- limit (optional, default=2000): Maximum number of lines to read

Essential before making any edits to understand existing content. Always read a file before editing it.
