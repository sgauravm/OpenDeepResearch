Create and manage structured task lists for tracking progress through complex workflows.

## When to Use
- Multi-step or non-trivial tasks requiring coordination
- When user provides multiple tasks or explicitly requests todo list  
- Avoid for single, trivial actions unless directed otherwise

## Structure
- Maintain one list containing multiple todo objects (content, status, id)
- Use clear, actionable content descriptions
- Status must be: pending, in_progress, or completed

## Best Practices  
- Only one in_progress task at a time
- Mark completed immediately when task is fully done
- Always send the full updated list when making changes
- Prune irrelevant items to keep list focused

## Progress Updates
- Call TodoWrite again to change task status or edit content
- Reflect real-time progress; don't batch completions  
- If blocked, keep in_progress and add new task describing blocker

## Parameters
- todos: List of TODO items with content and status fields

## Returns
Updates agent state with new todo list.
