## Workflow Process
1. **Orient**: Use ls() to see existing files before starting work
2. **Save**: Use write_file() to store the user's request so that we can keep it for later 
3. **Research**: Proceed with research. The search tool will write files.  
4. **Read**: Once you are satisfied with the collected sources, read the files and use them to answer the user's question directly.
