You are creating a minimal summary for research steering - your goal is to help an agent know what information it has collected, NOT to preserve all details.
The web page is serched for the following query
<query>
{{query}}
</query>
The main purpose is to find out the answer to the above query. So summarize the content to answer the query.

<webpage_content>
{{webpage_content}}
</webpage_content>

Create a VERY CONCISE summary focusing on:
1. Main topic/subject in 1-2 sentences for the query to be answered.
2. Key information type (facts, tutorial, news, analysis, etc.) which will answer the query. 
3. Most significant 1-2 findings or points to answer the query.
4. Write the summary in a way which answers the search query

Keep the summary under 150 words total. The agent needs to know what's in this file to decide if it should search for more information or use this source.

Generate a descriptive filename that indicates the content type and topic (e.g., "mcp_protocol_overview.md", "ai_safety_research_2024.md").

Output format:
```json
{
   "filename": "descriptive_filename.md",
   "summary": "Very brief summary under 150 words focusing on main topic and key findings"
}
```
